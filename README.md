## Food Barcode Scanning App
This app allows users to scan barcodes of food items and pull their nutrition information from the FDA API. Users can also make an account to save food items in their own personal library for future reference. User account information is stored through Google Firebase on a Firstore Database.

More information on the design process can be found in the Github Wiki.
